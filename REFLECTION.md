REFLECTION

1. ** What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code? **
Reading and commenting on this code helped me better understand how higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() are used in actual programming. Adding comments made me slow down and explain what each function was doing. Writing the comments also helped me see how breaking code into small functions makes it easier to read and test.

2. ** What was the most confusing part? ** 
The most confusing part was understanding how filter() and length work together to count items. At first, it was not clear to me that filter() returns a new array, and that length counts the number of items in that array. Once I thought about it step by step and rewrote the comment in simpler words, it made more sense and helped me understand what the code was actually doing.
